## 24 Game Solver

This application is a solver for the classic 24 game. The 24 game is a popular arithmetic game where the objective is to find a way to manipulate four integers so that the end result is 24. The rules are that you must use each of the four numbers exactly once, and you can combine them using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features

- Solves the 24 game: Given four integers, the application will find a way to combine them to reach 24, if possible.
- Customizable target: While the traditional game aims for 24, this application allows you to change the target to other numbers like 1, providing a new level of challenge and flexibility.

## How to Use

1. Input your numbers: Enter the four integers you want to use.
